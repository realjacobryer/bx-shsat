        <!--Introduction-->
        <p>The top nine high schools in New York City are also known as "specialized high schools." According to <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/enrollment/enroll-grade-by-grade/specialized-high-schools"> their website,</a> specialized high
          schools "support the educational needs of students who excel academically and/or artistically, including English Language Learners and students with an IEP or 504 Plan." While the true value of attending these schools <a
            href="https://economics.mit.edu/files/9518"> has been studied before,</a> the prestige of a specialized school remains.</p>
        <p> However, before entering into one of the nine schools, students must pass through a screening process which includes the high stakes Specialized High School Admissions Test. This process has led to specialized high schools being called
          "selectively public" by some and segregationist by others.</p>
        <p>The student activist group Teens Take Charge have <a href="https://www.teenstakecharge.com/unscreen"> sued the NYC Department of Education </a> to do away with the screening process, calling it classist and racist by segregating out poor
          students and students of color. The DOE has said that <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/learning/programs/dream-program"> diversity initiatives </a> have helped and the situation is getting better.</p>
        <p>According to Emma García, an education policy expert with the Economic Policy Institute, American schools, even six decades after <i> Brown v. Board of Education </i>, are still heavily segregated. </p>
        <p>"Black children are fives times to attend schools that are highly segregated compare to their white classmate," García said in an email response. "This has lasting consequences for children. If they are able to attend schools that white
          students attend, we see a better sult on standardized math tests. If not, the cycle continues." </p>
        <p> An analysis of data from the DOE shows a tendency of Bronx schools successful with the SHSAT are less impoverished and whiter than average.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="title"> <strong> Methodology </strong> </p>
        <p> This story was constructed using data <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2018-2019-SHSAT-Admissions-Test-Offers-By-Sending-/uf53-ree9"> from the New York City Department of Education. </a></p>
        <p> Using avaliable testing data from 2015 to 2019, all Bronx schools were ranked using a simple formula to determine SHSAT success rate. The number of student testers divided by the number of specialized high school offers. </p>
        <img class="c_half" src="mapping-webpage/images/Formula1.png" alt="file not found">
        <p> In many cases, the exact number of offers was not avaliable, as "0-5 offers" is the lowest outcome in the datasets. For those cases where exact offers could not be determined, a greater success rate was assumed with a smaller number of
          student testers. (If a school is testing 100 students, but only 0-5 offers are given, that is less successful than a school testing 15 students with 0-5 offers.)</p>
        <p> In addition, <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2018-2019-School-Demographic-Snapshot/45j8-f6um"> demographic data </a> from schools is used later in the story to further draw conclusions about the SHSAT. The combined table
          with both SHSAT ranking and demographic data can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GHuS42eDB7FCtyqMqz8qt8xYplcpp3wQSLLOJhUqRCg/edit?usp=sharing"> here. </a> </p>
        <p>The resulting SHSAT performance map, with all 147 Bronx schools, is displayed below.</p>

                if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                  for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                    var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                    t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
                  }
              }))
            }();

        </figure>
        <p> &nbsp;</p>
        <p> This map is not determining overall quality of a school, but rather their performance in relation to the SHSAT. </p>
        <p> About half of eligible students in Bronx schools took the test from 2015 to 2019. The best perfoming schools generally stayed within that 50% mark, meaning their students were not overly taking the SHSAT. </p>
        <p> Although applying for admission to a specialized high school is up to the individual family, certain schools, particularly
          charter schools, have high numbers of students taking the SHSAT, which does not always translate to success.</p>

        <!--Economic Need Index-->
        <p class="title"><strong> Bronx schools that performed better on the SHSAT tended to be less impoverished.</strong></p>
        <p>The Economic Need Index estimates the percentage of students facing economic hardship. The greater the percentage, the more impoverished a school community is. </p>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/docs/default-source/default-document-library/diversity-in-new-york-city-public-schools-english"> the DOE,</a> if a school is more than 10 percent <i> above </i> the citywide average, it is
          skewed toward lower incomes; if a school is more than 10 percent <i> below </i> the citywide average, it is skewed toward higher incomes. The current average ENI for NYC is 72%. The median ENI for schools in the Bronx is 85%. This means
          most Bronx school communities have lower incomes than the rest of NYC.</p>
        <p>Among Bronx SHSAT performing schools, the ENI was lower than average, meaning those school communities were richer than most in the Bronx. For example, two of the most consistently good SHSAT schools, Riverdale/Kingsbridge Academy and M.S.
          101 Edward R. Bryne, were over 30% lower than
          the median, a comparitively huge jump down in ENI. </p>
        <p>(For readability, data in this map and the next has been filtered down to the top and bottom seven schools in SHSAT performance.)

        <p> &nbsp;</p>
        <p>The SHSAT has been accused of clasism based around the prepartion required for the test. After school programs and tutoring centers designed to prepare middle schoolers are common but can only be attended by those who can pay. 1-on-1
          tutoring from an "expert SHSAT teacher who will personalize your student's study plan" <a href="https://www.kaptest.com/shsatwith"> Kaplan test prep,</a> the first result on a Google search, costs $1599 ("with as low as $134/month at 0%
          APR").</p>
        <p>Anecdotally, the differences for rich and poor families are stark. Nina Worley, Nina Worley, a junior at Laugardia High School, and a member of Teens Take Charge, experienced this phenomenon firsthand.</p>
        <p>"I was on the subway. There was a mother, with her young child, and she was doing flashcards with him. She's speaking to him in Spanish, saying 'I'm going to prep you for this test now okay?' And these are not small words like 'dog' or
          something. He's an
          elementary student and repeating these really huge words," Worley said. "Not every single person can afford those flashcards or has the time. Black and brown parents, parents from struggling families, they're working, they're making ends
          meet."</p>
        <p>The group Parent Leaders for Accelerated Curriculum and Eduation (PLACE) <a href="https://placenyc.org/2020/02/02/position-statement-on-shsat/"> supports the SHSAT </a> and think it can be reformed, rather than removed. Solutions such as
          alternative testing times, support for low-income student prep, and doubling the amount of specialized high schools will increase the diversity in the top tier schools. </p>
        <p>"See I wish it was just as simple as that, but more locations for testing sites is not enough," said Far Priette, a junior at Boerum Hill School for International Studies and member of TTC's steering committee. "It's not nearly enough.
          Some of
          these students, some of my friends have been having prep for specialized high schools since they were in elementary school. I didn't even know the high school admissions process until I was head on with it in eigth grade. I didn't have the
          support in my school, which was primarily black and brown."

        <p class="title"><strong> Bronx schools that were successful on the SHSAT also tended to be whiter than average.</strong></p>
        <div>
          <p>Demographically, Bronx schools are made up of majority Black and Hispanic students. The median value for % white students in schools was just barely over 1%. Across NYC, <a
              href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/about-us/reports/doe-data-at-a-glance"> the demographic breakdown </a> is 40.6% Hispanic, 25.5% Black, 16.2% Asian, and 15.1% White.</p>
          <p>Among Bronx schools that performed well on the SHSAT, there was a clear trend of schools with whiter populations succeeding more. With an average rate of 33% white students from 2015 to 2019, P.S. 083 Donald Hertz had the third highest
            rate of white students. It also consistently placed in the top ten of SHSAT performing schools with an average success rank of 5.75. </p>
          <p>The schools that performed worse on the SHSAT fell far closer to the meidan % of white students in the Bronx. J.H.S. 80 The Mosholu Parkway, was the greatest proportion with 19% white students while having a SHSAT success rank of 141.

        <p>Similar to claims on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2019/12/11/lawsuit-claims-sat-and-act-are-biased-heres-what-research-says/?sh=6fcf897a3c42"> the SAT and ACT assessments,</a> the SHSAT has also been accused of racial
          bias in its questions and grading. Although far more Hispanic students take the test, they are <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6815328-2020-SHSAT-Overall-Summary-1-2-1.html"> not given offers </a> at the same rate as white
          students. In 2020, over 6000 Hispanic students took the SHSAT with 280 getting offers. 4700 white
          students took the same test and 1072 recieved offers from specialized high schools.</p>
        <p> Worley's own school is one of the nine specialized high schools where she says the process of screening out students of color has internalized by some of her own classmates.</p>
        <p> "Many of them are perfomative. When I hear other students say 'Its going to be too hard for them,' the real meaning is 'Our school isn't for you', " Worley, who identifies as Latinx, said. </p>
        <p>The DOE has repeatedly stated they are committed to the goal of diversity and equity in schools.</p>
        <p> “Our classrooms are stronger and more supportive for all students when they reflect the diversity of our city, and we sincerely value student voice in our ongoing efforts to advance equity,” Katie O’Hanlon, Deputy Press Secretary at the
          NYC DOE, said in an email response.
        <p> O’Hanlon said the DOE has been making progress through their District
          Diversity and New York State Integration Project grants, which offers funding to schools for “putting forward compelling ideas” and developing “integration plans” to increase diversity. The DOE also have not added any screened programs to
          the school system.</p>
        <p> Worley, who challenged the mayor during a segment <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/ask-mayor-10192020/"> on the Brian Lehrer show,</a> thinks that he could have and should have done more. </p>
        <p> "[Mayor Bill de Blasio] had, what, six years? He and [Chancellor Richard] Carranza said they would help, said they would fix the problem. And it's still here," Worley said. "That's why Teens Take Charge sued them. That's why we're not
          staying quiet." </p>
